##🍷 Red Wine Quality Prediction
This project explores the prediction of red wine quality using machine learning techniques. Both regression and classification approaches are implemented to evaluate the effectiveness of different models.

#🔍Objective
Predict the wine quality score (0–10 scale) using physicochemical attributes from a red wine dataset.

#📁 Project Structure
Red_Wine_Quality1_copy.ipynb: End-to-end notebook including data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

#📊 Features Used
Fixed acidity, Volatile acidity, Citric acid, Residual sugar, Chlorides, Free sulfur dioxide, Total sulfur dioxide, Density, pH, Sulphates, Alcohol.

#🧠 Machine Learning Models
Random Forest Regressor

Random Forest Classifier

GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning

#📈 Evaluation Metrics
Regressor: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R² Score
